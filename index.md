Our laboratory is interested in this beautiful but complex question. In other words, we seek to understand gene regulation in the context of a 3D genome. Using in vivo models, we aim to decipher how cellular fate is set and maintained, and how this information is encoded in vertebrate genomes.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Our research uses approaches to map 3D chromatin structures and regulatory elements, as well as cutting-edge genome editing technologies. This combination of methods allows us to define 3D regulatory landscapes with accuracy and assess their functionality in vivo. We carry out two key lines of research: the developmental principles of 3D chromatin organization and the mechanisms underlying vertebrate sex determination.
