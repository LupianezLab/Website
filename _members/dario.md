I performed my PhD at the University of Granada (Spain) under the supervision of Dr. Rafael Jimenez. During this period, I studied sex determination and gonadal development in a non-model organism, the iberian mole Talpa occidentalis.

In 2012, I started my Postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics under the supervision of Prof. Stefan Mundlos. During this period, my main research focus was chromatin architecture and disease.

In 2017-2023, I worked at the Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology (BIMSB), Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC), as a junior group leader.

From 2023, I lead the “3D Genomics” lab at the Centro Andaluz de Biologia del Desarrollo (CABD), Junta de Andalucía – UPO – CSIC.

When I am not in the lab I am playing/watching football (Real Madrid CF) or playing some guitar riffs.
