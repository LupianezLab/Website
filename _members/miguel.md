I am interested in life sciences and molecular biology which led me to study Biotechnology at the Technical University of Madrid. I also spent a year at the Polytechnic Institute of Setúbal in Lisbon (Portugal), gaining experience in bioinformatics and meeting the lovely portuguese culture. In my bachelor’s thesis, I performed gene expression analysis in response to drought in quinoa crops.
Later on, I pursued a Master in Computational Biology at the Technical University of Madrid. There, I joined María Gómez’s group at the Severo Ochoa Molecular Biology Center, where I studied a fascinating topic: the role of 3D chromatin structure in gene regulation.
I recently moved to Seville to start my PhD at Lupiañez Lab, where I’m working on an exciting project to understand how sex determination mechanisms evolved in two different Xenopus species.
In my free time, I love to play basketball, read some books, and relax with friends over drinks, taking advantage of Seville’s wonderful weather ☀️
