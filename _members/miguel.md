Interested in life sciences and molecular biology, I decided to study Biotechnology at the Technical University of Madrid (UPM). Later on, I pursued a Master in Computational Biology motivated by the challenge of understanding big amounts of data in biological research. Then, as part of my master thesis, I found a very cool topic of research: the role of 3D genome in gene regulation.

I recently moved to Seville to start my PhD at Lupiañez Lab, where I’m working on a project to understand how sex determination mechanisms evolved in two different Xenopus species. I find that a great combination of gene regulation, evolution and 3D genomics. In my free time, I love to play basketball, read some books, and relax with friends over drinks, taking advantage of Seville’s wonderful weather ☀️
