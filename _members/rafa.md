I obtained my PhD at the University Pablo de Olavide in Sevilla (Spain) in 2019 under the supervision of Dr. José Luis Gómez-Skarmeta. I studied how chromatin architecture changes were essential for the evolution of gene regulation at the origin of vertebrates using zebrafish and amphioxus as models.

Since then I became passionate about the relationships between gene regulation, development and evolution. Therefore, I joined Dr. Darío Lupiáñez lab now to explore how the different mechanisms of sex determination of vertebrates originated and evolved from a gene regulatory angle using single-cell technologies.

Out of the lab, and when not discussing science with friends and a nice pint of beer, I also enjoy playing basketball and chess and trying to find nice lost spots in the surrounding nature.
