I obtained my bachelor's degree in Biotechnology at UMH in Elche. Then, I moved to Granada, where I pursued a Master's in Genetics and Evolution at UGR. Interested in how genomes accommodate new developmental programs, I joined the Lupiáñez lab and I am now pursuing a PhD in sex determination using single-cell technologies, with the rabbit as a model.
In my free time, I love hanging out with friends and playing sports together—I really enjoy the laughter and energy we share. I also love traveling and exploring cool new places!
