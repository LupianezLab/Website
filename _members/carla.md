Fascinated by science, I studied Biotechnology at the University of Cádiz and then I pursued a Master's degree in Health Biotechnology at Pablo de Olavide University in Seville. Afterwards, I moved to France, where I worked for 3 years as a research assistant in a pluripotent stem cell lab. Recently, I started studying embryonic development and have now joined the Lupiañez Lab to assist with their incredible research projects.
In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my friends, going to indie music concerts, and traveling around the world!
