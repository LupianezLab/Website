I completed my PhD at the University of Granada (Spain) in 2018 under the supervision of Drs. Francisco J. Barrionuevo and Miguel Burgos. My study was focused on the role of several sex determination master genes and microRNAs in testicular function.

Recently, I joined Lupiañez Lab thanks to a postdoctoral fellowship from the Alfonso Martín Escudero Foundation. I am working on a very exciting project that combines lineage tracing, tetraploid complementation assays and single-cell technologies to study genetic disorders in sex development.
In my free time, I enjoy traveling, tasting the gastronomy of each place and of course, as a Biologist, I love exploring natural environments!
