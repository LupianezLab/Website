I completed my Bachelor's degree in Genomic Biotechnology in Mexico before moving to Barcelona to pursue my Master's at UAB. During my master's thesis, I studied the impact of Robertsonian fusions on mouse spermatogenesis. Fascinated by genome organization, I am now a PhD student at the LupiaÃ±ez Lab, where I focus on the dynamics of 3D chromatin organization during limb development.

Beyond the lab, I love exploring the city, finding great places for delicious desserts (mmmh, churros!), and enjoying coffee and beer in equal measure. Iâ€™m always up for a good chat with friends on a sunny terraceâ€”luckily, Sevilla has plenty of them! ðŸ˜œ
